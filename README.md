# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program is Grocery Tracking Program. The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. 

The program that the Corner Grocer is asking you to create should address the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day:

Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
